    "Finally, apart from the requests package, you are encouraged to not use any third party Python packages, such as pandas, and instead focus on what's available in the Python Standard Library (the collections module might come in handy: https://pymotw.com/3/collections/). Also, since you won't have access to DataFrames, you are encouraged to us Python's native data structures - preferably dictionaries, though some questions can also be answered using lists. You can read more on these data structures here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html\n",
